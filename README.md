BMW Car Sales Data Cleaning & EDA Project

Project Overview
 - This project focuses on cleaning and preparing BMW car sales data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate meaningful insights. The dataset initially contained missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, which were addressed in the ETL process. EDA was conducted to visualize trends and distribution patterns across key variables.

Project Structure
1. ETL.py: Data cleaning and preprocessing module
 - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
 - Standardized numerical fields (e.g., price, mileage, engine size) and categorical variables (e.g., model, region, fuel type).
 - Detected and removed outliers using IQR and verified data quality through boxplots.

2. EDA.py: Exploratory data analysis
 - Plotted annual average price trends.
 - Visualized total sales by region using bar plots.
 - Saved figures for reporting purposes.

Key Deliverables
 - Cleaned, structured dataset ready for analysis or modeling
